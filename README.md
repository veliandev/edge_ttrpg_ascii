# EoTE ASCII TTRPG

### Honestly, you should probably hit up Releases unless you wanna work on the project- In which case:

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ttrpg, git: "https://github.com/veliandev/edge_ttrpg_ascii.git"}
  ]
end
```

`mix run --no-halt` to get up and running. We're using [burrito](https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito.git) to build releases; check their requirements for running `mix release` and not running into issues.
